# The database of next generation

## 1. Ready for more complex application scenarios

Kubelego is ready to meet your requirements for more complex application scenarios, aiming to solving the technical and costs challenges you are faced with.

## 2. Open source and neutral

Although current cloud vendors have public data management platforms, they only support a few mainstream databases. Third-party proprietary open source licenses are never fully-supported, because in essence cloud vendors cannot achieve open source and be neutral.

## 3. The requirement of multi-cloud and hybrid cloud management

You may use not single cloud platforms (AWS, Axure, Google Cloud) and with self-built cloud platforms (hybrid cloud). And cloud vendors cannot be neutral about open source software. Kubelego provides an easy way for database management and long-term maintenance.

## 4. The chronic problem of data silo

Kubelego is a unified data management interface. Under a unified management interface, effective unification can be achieved off-line. This is a problem that the current data lake and data warehouse products can not effectively solve, and the data lake itself is another relatively large data silo.
