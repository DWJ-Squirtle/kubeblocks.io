# The data base of next generation

## 1 Exploding period of databases

Databases are in an era of product explosion. Besides of the emerging database products, databases have expanded from the traditional TP databases to TP/AP/NewSQL and other databases. Databases also expand from general type to industry-specific refinement, such as Redis/MongoDB/InfluxDB. In such an era, we are ready to meet your requirements for more complex application scenarios, aiming to solving the technical and cost challenge you are faced with.

## 2 Open source and neutral

Although current cloud vendors have public data management platforms, cloud platforms can only support a few mainstream databases, failing to cover for the long tail. The problem of third-party proprietary open source licenses, in essence, lies in that cloud vendors cannot achieve open source and be neutral.

## 3. The requirement of multi-cloud and hybrid cloud management

You may use not single cloud platforms (aws, axure, Google cloud) and with self-built cloud platforms (hybrid cloud). And cloud vendors cannot be neutral about open source software; We provide a easy way for database management and long-term maintenance.

## 4. The chronic problem of data silo

We provide a unified data management interface. Under a unified management interface, effective unification can be achieved off-line. This is a problem that the current data lake and data warehouse products can not effectively solve, and the data lake itself is another relatively large data silo.

## 5. Open source software provided

Open source is now definitely the main stream. We provide the open source version of software.
