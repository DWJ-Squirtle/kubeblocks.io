# Kubeblocks docs website

This repo contains the source code of [kubeblocks website](https://kubeblocks.io). It's built by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Contributing to Kubeblocks EN Docs
First, we have the source documentation in [Kubeblocks repo](https://github.com/apecloud/kubeblocks/tree/main/docs) and it's written in English.  Any doc files modifid will trigger the Github action to run and validate the docs could be build successfully into the website. 

The Github-Action there will parse the document and publish it to the Kubeblocks Website automatically.

Please follow our guides below to learn how to preview the docs in the right way.
