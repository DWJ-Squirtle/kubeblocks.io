# CloudApe writing style guide

> Every word matters. When you are called upon to write about technology, you need a simple, straightforward style guide that everyone can use in your organization, regardless of your role.
> The style guide is not a right-or-wrong criteria but a preference of your organization, the voice and style you choose to talk to your audiences, either it is warm and relaxed, crisp and clear, or showing that you are ready to lend a hand.

## 1 CloudApe brand voice-simple and human
### 1.1 What do we mean by voice

The voice is how we talk to people. It’s the interplay of personality, substance, tone, and style.
Though our voice is constant regardless of who we’re talking to or what we’re saying, we adapt our tone—from serious to empathetic to lighthearted—to fit the context and the customer's state of mind.

- Formal and relaxed—We’re natural. We are formal, but more grounded in real, everyday conversations. 
- Crisp and clear—We are to the point. We write for scanning first, reading second. We make it simple above all.
- Ready to lend a hand—We show customers we’re on their side. We anticipate their real needs and offer great information at just the right time.
- Occasionally, we’re fun. (We know when to celebrate.)

### 1.2 Tips to get a grasp a general idea of our style and voice
#### 1.2.1 The fewer words the better

Our modern design hinges on crisp minimalism. Shorter is always better. 

> **Example**
> - Not this: If you're ready to purchase our product for your organization, contact your account representative.
> - But this: Ready to buy? Contact us.

#### 1.2.2 Write like you speak

UI is a communication, we always write like a robot for UI content. Read your text aloud. Does it sound like something a real person would say? Be friendly and conversational. No. Robot. Words. 

> **Example**
> - Not this: Invalid ID
> - But this: You need an ID that looks like this: someone@example.com

#### 1.2.3 Get to the point fast

Start with what’s most important, for example, the benefit for customers are the most important and needs to be addressed first. Front-load keywords for scanning. Make customer choices and next steps obvious. The trend for modern content writing is to write **scannable content**, **because modern readers never read**.

> **Example**
> - Not this: Templates provide a starting point for creating new documents. A template can include the styles, formats, and page layouts you use frequently. Consider creating a template if you often use the same page layout and style for documents.
> - But this: Save time by creating a document template that includes the styles, formats, and page layouts you use most often. Then use the template whenever you create a new document.

#### 1.2.4 Revise weak writing (for global audiences)

Most of the time, **start each statement with a verb(and this shows power)**. Edit out you can and there is, there are, there were. Note that when you write for Chinese audience, be careful, weak tone is the better choice.

> **Example**
> - Not this: You can access our apps across your devices, and you get online file storage and sharing.
> - But this: Store files online, access them from all your devices, and share them with coworkers.

#### 1.2.5 Only capitalize the first words
Default to sentence-style capitalization—capitalize only the first word of a heading or phrase and any proper nouns or names. Never Use Title Capitalization (Like This). Never Ever.   
> **Examples**
> - Not these:
>   - Find a Partner
>   - Limited-Time Offer
>   - Join Us Online
> - But these:
>   - Find a partner
>   - Limited-time offer
>   - Join us online

#### 1.2.6 Skip periods on titles, headings (and : ! ?)

Skip end punctuation on titles, headings, subheads, UI titles, and items in a list that are three or fewer words. Save the periods for paragraphs and body copy. 

> **Examples**
> - Not this:
> Move a tile.
>   1. Press and hold the tile.
> - But this: 
> Move a tie
>   1. Press and hold the title.

#### 1.2.7 Remember the last comma

In a list of three or more items, include a comma before the conjunction. (The comma that comes before the conjunction is known as the Oxford or serial comma.)

> **Examples**
> - Not this: - Android, iOS and Windows
> - But this: Android, iOS, and Windows

## 2 Bias-free communication

Since our business is targeted at global customers and reaches every part of the globe one day, it's crucial that all our communications are inclusive and diverse.

### 2.1 Gender-neutral alternatives

| **Use this**     | **Not this** | 
| :---             | :---         | 
| chair, moderator | chairman     | 
| humanity, people, humankind| man, mankind| 
| operates, staffs | mans |
| sales representative | salesman |
| synthetic, manufactured | manmade|
| workforce, staff, personnel | manpower |

Don't use _he_, _him_, _his_, _she_, _her_, or _hers_ in generic references. Instead:
- Rewrite to use the second person (_you_).
- Rewrite the sentence to have a plural noun and pronoun.
- Use the or a instead of a pronoun (for example, "the document").
- Refer to a person's role (_reader_, _employee_, _customer_, or _client_, for example).
- Use person or _individual_.

When you're writing about a real person, use the pronouns that person prefers, whether it's _he_, _she_, _they_, or another pronoun. It's OK to use gendered pronouns (like _he_, _she_, _his_, and _hers_) when you're writing about real people who use those pronouns themselves.

### 2.2 Represent diverse perspectives and circumstances

Depict a variety of people from all walks of life participating fully in activities. Be inclusive of gender identity, race, culture, ability, age, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic class in an image. Show people in a wide variety of professions, educational settings, locales, and economic settings. Avoid using examples that reflect primarily a Western or affluent lifestyle. In drawings or blueprints of buildings, show ramps for wheelchair accessibility.

### 2.3 Be mindful of politically sensitive problems

Be mindful when you refer to various parts of the world. If you name cities, countries, or regions in examples, make sure they're not politically disputed. In examples that refer to several regions, use equivalent references—for example, don't mix countries with states or continents.

### 2.4 Avoid racial bias

Don't use terms that may carry unconscious racial bias or terms associated with military actions, politics, or historical events and eras.

| **Use this**     | **Not this** | 
| :---             | :---         | 
| primary/subordinate | master/slave     |
| perimeter netwoek | demilitarized zone (DMZ) |
| stop responding | hang |

## 3 Global communication

This section will help you write content for worldwide communication. To communicate with global customers, the first step we take is localization. Localization is the process of adapting a product or content (including text and other elements) to meet the language, cultural, and political expectations and requirements of a specific local market (locale). Localization is done by people who are familiar with the local language and culture. Refer to [W3C Internationalization Activity](https://www.w3.org/International/) to learn more about worldwide audiences.

### 3.1 Currency

#### Currency names

In general, lowercase the names of currencies, but capitalize the reference to the country or region.

> **Examples**
> US dollar
> Canadian dollar
> Hong Kong SAR dollar
> Brazilian real
> South African rand
> Pricing through the Database Product is shown in US dollars.

#### Specific monetary amounts

When you're referencing specific amounts of money, use the currency code, followed by the amount, with no space.

> **Example**
> The company generated BRL2.89 billion (USD1.42 billion) in net revenue in 2015.
> If it's clear which currency you mean, it's OK to use just the symbol. When referring to a specific amount in euros, use the euro symbol (€), not the word euros.

> **Examples**
> One of the largest companies in the United States, Adatum Corporation generated $1.42 billion in net revenue in 2015.
> Adatum Corporation generated €1.42 billion in net revenue in 2015.

### 3.2 Time and place

#### Dates

- Begin calendars on Mondays, which is the custom in much of the world.
- Use the date format _month dd_, _yyyy_. Don’t use numerals to represent months. For example, use January 5, 2018.

#### Time

- Include the time zone when it matters to customers, such as in an event listing. In time stamps that automatically display the customer's local time, you don't need to include the time zone.
Seasons
- Don’t refer to seasons if you can avoid it. Talk about months or calendar quarters instead. If you must mention a specific season, establish the hemisphere, too. (Summer in the northern hemisphere is winter in the southern hemisphere.)

#### Places

- In event locations, include the country or region name.

### 3.3 Look and feel

#### Color

Choose carefully. Colors may have religious, cultural, or political significance, particularly colors used on flags or for country- or region-specific holidays. Neutral and brand colors are usually OK. Your international program manager can provide guidance.

#### Images

Choose simple or generic images that are appropriate worldwide. Soccer players and equipment, generic landscapes and settings, pens and pencils, international highway signs, and historic artifacts are appropriate images worldwide.

- Avoid holiday or seasonal images.
- Avoid major landmarks and well-known buildings, which may have legal protections or be associated with politics or religion.
- Social or work situations involving men and women are risky in a few locales.
- Don’t use hand signs.
- Don’t use art based on English idioms.

Limit graphics and animations online. In some countries or regions, long page-loading times can be expensive.
If you use text in graphics, make sure it's easy to edit. Automatic translation software won’t translate it. If possible, use captions or describe the graphic in text, instead.

Create descriptive alt text for images, especially button images, which readers may not understand.

Store art in a separate file and link to it from within a document if possible. Localizers can modify art that isn’t embedded in the document.

Check restrictions on imported content in countries or regions where the content will be used. Be especially careful with maps, which may be subject to government review. Improper treatment of a disputed area may be illegal in some countries.

### 3.4 Tips for all global content

These practices will help localizers and customers.

Write short, simple sentences. Punctuating a sentence with more than a few commas and end punctuation usually indicates a complex sentence. Consider rewriting it or breaking it into multiple sentences.

Replace complex sentences and paragraphs with lists and tables.

Include _that_ and _who_. They help to clarify the sentence structure.

> **Examples**
> Inspect the database to verify that all tables, data, and relationships were correctly migrated.
> Select the checkbox of each folder that you want to sync with your desktop.

Include articles, such as _the_. Articles help readers and translation software identify the nouns and modifiers in a sentence.

> **Examples**
> Empty the container.
> The empty container

If necessary for clarity, include verbs in short headings and UI labels. For example, say _Access is denied_ instead of _Access denied_.

Use sentence-style capitalization. Capitalize proper nouns only, including trademarks and the names of products.
Avoid idioms, colloquial expressions, and culture-specific references. They can be confusing for non-native English speakers and hard to localize. Consider the worldwide implications of what you write. Customers in other locales may not know much about the history and culture of your country.

Avoid modifier stacks. Long chains of modifying words are confusing even to native English speakers. For example, say "Your migration will proceed more smoothly if you have a project plan that's well thought out," not "With an extremely well thought-out Windows migration project plan, your migration will go more smoothly."

Use active voice and indicative mood most of the time. Use imperative mood in procedures.

Keep adjectives and adverbs close to the words they modify. Pay particular attention to the placement of _only_.

Avoid linking more than three phrases or clauses by using coordinate conjunctions such as _and_, _or_, or _but_. Better yet, avoid linking more than two.
